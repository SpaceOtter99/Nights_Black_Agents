The borders of the Balkans are, due to many contrasting definitions, disputed. There exists no universal agreement on the region's components. The term by most definitions fully encompasses [[Albania]], [[Bosnia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Greece]], [[Kosovo]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], European [[Turkey]], and a large part of [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]]. Sometimes the term also includes [[Romania]] and southern parts of [[Slovenia]]. [[Italy]], although by some definitions having a small part of its territory on the Peninsula, is generally excluded.
