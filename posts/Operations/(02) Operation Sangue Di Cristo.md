We approach the [[Croatia|Croatian]] border. [[Dazzer]] calls in a favour with the [[Serbian Mafia|Nasa Stvar]] using his connections to the [[Russian Mafia]]. A large group of [[Serbian Mafia|Nasa Stvar]] members begin driving around in similar cars and group matchups to us to distract the police from noticing us. [[Dazzer]] also goes to bribe the [[Croatia|Croatian]] border guardsman with £10,000. He asks what we're doing in [[Croatia]], and [[Dazzer]] says that we're just passing through, using his Cop Talk proficiency to explain exactly what we've just done - e.g. that we're foreigners who've passed through [[Serbia]] on the way to [[Italy|Naples]]. He tries to extort more money from us and [[Dazzer|Daz]] pays him another £25,000 in crypto. 

We drive to [[Italy]] via [[Slovenia]], encountering no issues at the borders. After a picturesque drive south past [[Italy|Rome]], we reach [[Italy|Naples]]. The NATO base is out to the west of [[Italy|Naples]], approximately 30 minutes away. The base is more of an administrative centre than a military base.

[[Firebolt]] proposes sneaking into the base pretending to be blood donors, whereas [[Dazzer]] proposes a stakeout so they get more information first. We do a stakeout of the area, basing ourselves at a restaurant, and note that most employers carpool in in high end business cars. A bike (BMW R-1200c) labelled "emergency blood" travels to the front of the queue and passes without many checks. 7 ambulance-style refrigerated trucks also visit, 6 of which leave again -- however, we have no idea how many contained blood. Both the last truck of the day, and the bike, do not leave. [[Firebolt]] notes that emergency notes that the blood bikes normally leave at speed instead of arrive at speed. 

[[Dazzer]] stays overnight, where only one truck arrives, but also later leaves - it is not refrigerated though. The missing truck from yesterday also left at 7AM in the morning. [[Pierre]] and [[Firebolt]] head off to investigate the [[VCA]] to check the information from the bike. After queuing for a long time, [[Pierre]] cites a freedom of information request to avoid queuing again for a longer time. The bike is a government vehicle so we can't get all the information, but we are able to get some information on the company that owns it.

We are given the address of [[Italy|Ospedale S. Maria degli Incurabili]] ("Hospital of the Incurables"). [[Pierre]] fakes accessing from an internal domain and gets access to all of their records thanks to poor cyber security. However, the records only go back to 2004. [[Firebolt]] calls in a favour from a contact, [[Hans]], who is a member of the German Archaeological Society. He takes a ground-penetrating scanner to the graveyard where Popov is supposed to be interred. We should get the data back in 2 days.

[[Pierre]] and [[Firebolt]] go to stake out [[Italy|Ospedale S. Maria degli Incurabili]]. The hospital has a number of unmarked cars, in addition to two parked emergency bikes. In addition to a front entrance to a pharmacy, there is a front desk to a hospital run by nuns and a chapel. These are all publicly accessible. Not all buildings have a clear purpose. We also see that there a number of articles written by doctors there, which implies this is also a research hospital.

We realise we can tap the phone wire, so [[Pierre]] dresses as an electrician and infiltrates the building. [[Firebolt]] plans a good route through the building that will visit the only likely places for a telephone switchboard. Being an expert of disguise, [[Pierre]] easily gets past the entrance and into the building. The first location has been remodelled to look like it is ancient, but actually isn't. On the way to the 2nd location he sees a particularly gory and realistic statue of Christ that would not normally be seen in catholic or renaissance buildings. There is also a [[Malta|Maltese]] cross at the bottom of the statue. The second location contains the telephone switchboard, and [[Pierre]] easily sets up the wiretap. Two nuns walk past, smelling strongly of garlic. [[Pierre]] leaves without incident. 

[[Firebolt]] has a text from [[Hans]]
> Hey bro! Results in from that preliminary GPR, fairly bog standard, strong countryside here though. Bring your attention to grid 631:876, there's an area of significantly churned soil here around here. Couldn't help notice it was centred on a tombstone with fresh flowers on it, name was Dusko Popov. I read his book! Creepy. Hans

 Through traffic analysis, [[Firebolt]] notes that Dusko Popov's grave is empty. Additionally, the graves nearby in an approximately 10m radius are all empty. There might be bodies, but there are definitely no caskets. 

Early in the morning, we get a phone call from the hospital that starts with "da?" (Which could be from many European languages). "We have a request, ETA is 23 minutes". We see a gilded wooden box loaded into the blood box on the bike. There is a [[Malta|Maltese]] cross on the bike. Luckily, [[Firebolt]] prepared for this. He got [[Pierre]] to plant tracking bugs on the motorbike. The bike goes to the [[NATO]] [[Italy|Naples]] base, stays for roughly 4 hours, and then comes back the shortest route to [[Italy|Ospedale S. Maria degli Incurabili]]. We also realise that the air traffic from our stakeout so far doesn't seem to match the emergency deliveries. 

On the news that evening, we hear the there has been a dead [[NATO]] general discovered in [[Bosnia|Sarajevo]]. We know that it's radiation poisoning from our general contacts. 

[[Firebolt]] establishes the best spot to intercept him is at a hairpin at the start of a downhill going the wrong way down a one way street. The biker will likely be going quite slow. Additionally, they make a copy of the driver's clothes. A phone call for the bike doesn't come this day. The following day, at quarter to 10, another call comes through, with exactly the same wording as previously. 

We ready ourselves. [[Dazzer]] manoeuvres the car to block the bike at the perfect moment. The biker slows down, and [[Pierre]] jumps him to throw him off the bike. He gets on ready to drive away. [[Firebolt]] grabs the guy from the floor, rips off his helmet as he pleads for them to give him the bike back. The biker is around 60, with a well trimmed beard, and looks terrified. 

The biker uses an ikido move to throw [[Firebolt]] off, and stands up. [[Dazzer]] drives the car out the way, and [[Firebolt]] narrowly manages to jump on top of the biker before he dives at [[Pierre]]. The biker fails to throw [[Firebolt]] off, and [[Pierre]] drives away. Despite not being a fantastic driver, [[Pierre]] gets very lucky and manages to go through several green lights in a row and make it in time. He says "Please. It is the blood of Christ."

[[Firebolt]] holds the man in a painful position, as [[Dazzer]] drags the pipe towards him and says "A whole lot of bad things are going to happen if you don't start talking. And I'm a doctor... so I can keep you conscious". The biker relays that the blood goes to the [[NATO]] base. We apply more pressure, and the biker relays that there is a man who drinks the blood of Christ who keeps the demons at bay. 

The pair use some interrogation techniques that [[Firebolt]] was taught to resist being close to [[American]] land. We talk the man through his delivery process whilst administering a cocktail of drugs and hypnosis techniques using [[Firebolt]]'s military science and [[Dazzer]]'s Pharmacology and Shrink skills.

We knock 3 times, one for the father, one for the son and one for the holy ghost. To [[Noble Jump]]. We take the blood into the sanctum to the cardinal, and you must not look at him. Do not look in his eyes. They keep demons within their souls and this blood reinforces them. [[Firebolt]] and [[Dazzer]] manage to avoid losing any stability through this harrowing supernatural experience.

[[Dazzer]] continues pressing the man to know what the demons he mentions are. 
>They are the Nephilim they are the accursed and the fallen they are Beelzebub and goliath they are incurable they are infallible they are lords they are beyond realms of physicality and spirituality they are legion they are Asmodeus. They are in all the cardinals

[[Pierre]] makes it to the [[NATO]] base. The soldiers walking around pay him no mind. [[Pierre]] takes a quick peek inside the gilded wooden box in the back of the bike. Inside is a large syringe made of dull matte plastic, containing blood. As he looks at it he feels as though he is crying and blood is seeping from his ears and hands and then he closes the box and is fine. [[Pierre]] proceeds on to the bunker, marked with a feather flag describing the [[Noble Jump]] 2023 demonstration. He knocks three times on the hard steel door and it creaks open. Anyone who has noticed [[Pierre]] promptly looks the other way. He proceeds down a set of stairs to another door, which is already open. 

The biker keeps babbling to [[Firebolt]] and [[Dazzer]]
>The holy order of the [[Knights of Malta]] we are a shield against the immaterial we are a shield we will bring salvation to the people and keep them in darkness we will protect them we will shroud them and protect them. 

[[Dazzer]] asks what would happen if the normal blood ran out. The man replies "Christ is in all of us". After more prompting he says that the blood is from the bishop, Vitali Udinesi, and that it is purer. We push more ketamin on the man, who we find is named Paul, and he drifts to drugged sleep.

[[Pierre]] enters a room swathed in candlelight. On it is a map of Europe, with a number of nodes that seem unrelated, apart from one in [[Italy|Naples]] and one in [[Serbia|Belgrade]]. [[Pierre]] commits the map to memory -- other nodes include [[England|London]], [[Manchester]], Several places in [[Romania]], several cities in [[Ukraine]], Lebanon, [[Lebanon|Beirut]], [[Palestine]], [[Egypt|Cairo]] and [[Italy|Rome]]. 

At the far side of the room is the silhouette of a man in [[NATO]] military dress. [[Pierre]] fakes a bow but continues looking at him. The man has a large moustache and looks similar to Mussolini (but importantly, is not). The man opens the box, takes the syringe out without incident, injects it under his tongue. His eyes roll back in his head and he gets an erection. 

The man says "Wait" in [[Romania|Romanian]]. "I have something for you to deliver to your master". He walks over and rifles through some documents in a filing cabinet. "Take these, very securely, to your master. Great importance that this is not fall into the wrong hands". He sounds like he is starting to slur his words, almost as if he has taken drugs. He hands [[Pierre]] a cold-war era folder with documents in. [[Pierre]] motions to ask if he can leave. 

>"You are not Paul"
"Paul couldn't make it today"
"Show me your face"

[[Pierre]] bluffs that he is going to take his helmet off and attempts to bolt for the door, and the man is completely blindsided. [[Pierre]] seems to think that the man is on Heroin from how he is acting. [[Pierre]], terrified, goes to sprint out the door and up the stairs, but the man catches up and grabs [[Pierre]]'s belt. The man's eyes are bloodshot, and his face animalisticaly contorts into almost a bird-like or ghoulish form as he screams and reaches for [[Pierre]]'s face. 

[[Pierre]]'s anti grappling training kicks in and he goes to remove the man's hand. Despite landing a powerful blow the man barely moves, but going to break his arm for a second time [[Pierre]] barely gets him off his belt. At neck-a-neck speeds [[Pierre]] gets out of the bunker first, and looks back to see that the man is not following, with a face like a dead shark. 

[[Pierre]] gets on the bike and heads out the same gate as the biker. He notices all of the cameras swivel to look at him. [[Pierre]] gets stopped at the gate, and the man checks his ID, talks to his friend for a few seconds, and then hands it back, allowing [[Pierre]] to leave. 

After recounting our previous experiences and what drew us here, we come to the conclusion that we are dealing with [[Vampires]]. Looking in the folder, we then see that across [[Serbia|Belgrade]], both in the townhouse and in the getaway car, there a number of photos of us. All of our faces have clean shots. There are no names however. We decide to leave.

We get a text from [[Georg Rudek|Rudek]] right as we're leaving.
