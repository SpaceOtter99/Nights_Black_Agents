# (02) Operation Sangue Di Cristo
## Session 1
We approach the [[Croatia|Croatian]] border. [[Dazzer]] calls in a favour with the [[Serbian Mafia|Nasa Stvar]] using his connections to the [[Russian Mafia]]. A large group of [[Serbian Mafia|Nasa Stvar]] members begin driving around in similar cars and group matchups to us to distract the police from noticing us. [[Dazzer]] also goes to bribe the [[Croatia|Croatian]] border guardsman with £10,000. He asks what we're doing in [[Croatia]], and [[Dazzer]] says that we're just passing through, using his Cop Talk proficiency to explain exactly what we've just done - e.g. that we're foreigners who've passed through [[Serbia]] on the way to [[Italy|Naples]]. He tries to extort more money from us and [[Dazzer|Daz]] pays him another £25,000 in crypto. We drive to [[Italy]] via [[Slovenia]], encountering no issues at the borders. After a picturesque drive south past [[Italy|Rome]], we reach [[Italy|Naples]]. 

### Reconnaisance
The NATO base is out to the west of [[Italy|Naples]], approximately 30 minutes away. The base is more of an administrative centre than a military base. [[Firebolt]] proposes sneaking into the base pretending to be blood donors, whereas [[Dazzer]] proposes a stakeout so they get more information first. We do a stakeout of the area, basing ourselves at a restaurant, and note that most employers carpool in in high end business cars. A bike (BMW R-1200c) labelled "emergency blood" travels to the front of the queue and passes without many checks. 7 ambulance-style refrigerated trucks also visit, 6 of which leave again -- however, we have no idea how many contained blood. Both the last truck of the day, and the bike, do not leave. [[Firebolt]] notes that emergency notes that the blood bikes normally leave at speed instead of arrive at speed. 

[[Dazzer]] stays overnight, where only one truck arrives, but also later leaves - it is not refrigerated though. The missing truck from yesterday also left at 7AM in the morning. [[Pierre]] and [[Firebolt]] head off to investigate the [[VCA]] to check the information from the bike. After queuing for a long time, [[Pierre]] cites a freedom of information request to avoid queuing again for a longer time. The bike is a government vehicle so we can't get all the information, but we are able to get some information on the company that owns it.

We are given the address of [[Italy|Ospedale S. Maria degli Incurabili]] ("Hospital of the Incurables"). [[Pierre]] fakes accessing from an internal domain and gets access to all of their records thanks to poor cyber security. However, the records only go back to 2004. [[Firebolt]] calls in a favour from a contact, [[Hans]], who is a member of the German Archaeological Society. He takes a ground-penetrating radar scanner to the graveyard where Popov is supposed to be interred. We should get the data back in 2 days.

[[Pierre]] and [[Firebolt]] go to stake out [[Italy|Ospedale S. Maria degli Incurabili]]. The hospital has a number of unmarked cars, in addition to two parked emergency bikes. In addition to a front entrance to a pharmacy, there is a front desk to a hospital run by nuns and a chapel. These are all publicly accessible. Not all buildings have a clear purpose. We also see that there a number of articles written by doctors there, which implies this is also a research hospital.

We realise we can tap the phone wire, so [[Pierre]] dresses as an electrician and infiltrates the building. [[Firebolt]] plans a good route through the building that will visit the only likely places for a telephone switchboard. Being an expert of disguise, [[Pierre]] easily gets past the entrance and into the building. The first location has been remodelled to look like it is ancient, but actually isn't. On the way to the 2nd location he sees a particularly gory and realistic statue of Christ that would not normally be seen in catholic or renaissance buildings. There is also a [[Malta|Maltese]] cross at the bottom of the statue. The second location contains the telephone switchboard, and [[Pierre]] easily sets up the wiretap. Two nuns walk past, smelling strongly of garlic. [[Pierre]] leaves without incident. 

[[Firebolt]] has a text from [[Hans]]
> Hey bro! Results in from that preliminary GPR, fairly bog standard, strong countryside here though. Bring your attention to grid 631:876, there's an area of significantly churned soil here around here. Couldn't help notice it was centred on a tombstone with fresh flowers on it, name was Dusko Popov. I read his book! Creepy. Hans

 Through traffic analysis, [[Firebolt]] notes that Dusko Popov's grave is empty. Additionally, the graves nearby in an approximately 10m radius are all empty. There might be bodies, but there are definitely no caskets. 

Early in the morning, we get a phone call from the hospital that starts with "da?" (Which could be from many European languages). "We have a request, ETA is 23 minutes". We see a gilded wooden box loaded into the blood box on the bike. There is a [[Malta|Maltese]] cross on the box. Luckily, [[Firebolt]] prepared for this. He got [[Pierre]] to plant tracking bugs on the motorbike. The bike goes to the [[NATO]] [[Italy|Naples]] base, stays for roughly 4 hours, and then comes back the shortest route to [[Italy|Ospedale S. Maria degli Incurabili]]. We also realise that the air traffic from our stakeout so far doesn't seem to match the emergency deliveries. 

On the news that evening, we hear the there has been a dead [[NATO]] general discovered in [[Bosnia|Sarajevo]]. We know that it's radiation poisoning from our general contacts. 

### Infiltration

[[Firebolt]] establishes the best spot to intercept him is at a hairpin at the start of a downhill going the wrong way down a one way street. The biker will likely be going quite slow. Additionally, they make a copy of the driver's clothes. A phone call for the bike doesn't come this day. The following day, at quarter to 10, another call comes through, with exactly the same wording as previously. 

We ready ourselves. [[Dazzer]] manoeuvres the car to block the bike at the perfect moment. The biker slows down, and [[Pierre]] jumps him to throw him off the bike. He gets on ready to drive away. [[Firebolt]] grabs the guy from the floor, rips off his helmet as he pleads for them to give him the bike back. The biker is around 60, with a well trimmed beard, and looks terrified. 

The biker uses an ikido move to throw [[Firebolt]] off, and stands up. [[Dazzer]] drives the car out the way, and [[Firebolt]] narrowly manages to jump on top of the biker before he dives at [[Pierre]]. The biker fails to throw [[Firebolt]] off, and [[Pierre]] drives away. Despite not being a fantastic driver, [[Pierre]] gets very lucky and manages to go through several green lights in a row and make it in time. He says "Please. It is the blood of Christ."

[[Firebolt]] holds the man in a painful position, as [[Dazzer]] drags the pipe towards him and says "A whole lot of bad things are going to happen if you don't start talking. And I'm a doctor... so I can keep you conscious". The biker relays that the blood goes to the [[NATO]] base. We apply more pressure, and the biker relays that there is a man who drinks the blood of Christ who keeps the demons at bay. 

The pair use some interrogation techniques that [[Firebolt]] was taught to resist being close to [[American]] land. We talk the man through his delivery process whilst administering a cocktail of drugs and hypnosis techniques using [[Firebolt]]'s military science and [[Dazzer]]'s Pharmacology and Shrink skills.

We knock 3 times, one for the father, one for the son and one for the holy ghost. To [[Noble Jump]]. We take the blood into the sanctum to the cardinal, and you must not look at him. Do not look in his eyes. They keep demons within their souls and this blood reinforces them. [[Firebolt]] and [[Dazzer]] manage to avoid losing any stability through this harrowing supernatural experience.

[[Dazzer]] continues pressing the man to know what the demons he mentions are. 
>"They are the Nephilim they are the accursed and the fallen they are Beelzebub and goliath they are incurable they are infallible they are lords they are beyond realms of physicality and spirituality they are legion they are Asmodeus. They are in all the cardinals"

[[Pierre]] makes it to the [[NATO]] base. The soldiers walking around pay him no mind. [[Pierre]] takes a quick peek inside the gilded wooden box in the back of the bike. Inside is a large syringe made of dull matte plastic, containing blood. As he looks at it he feels as though he is crying and blood is seeping from his ears and hands and then he closes the box and is fine. [[Pierre]] proceeds on to the bunker, marked with a feather flag describing the [[Noble Jump]] 2023 demonstration. He knocks three times on the hard steel door and it creaks open. Anyone who has noticed [[Pierre]] promptly looks the other way. He proceeds down a set of stairs to another door, which is already open. 

The biker keeps babbling to [[Firebolt]] and [[Dazzer]]
>"The holy order of the [[Knights of Malta]] we are a shield against the immaterial we are a shield we will bring salvation to the people and keep them in darkness we will protect them we will shroud them and protect them."

[[Dazzer]] asks what would happen if the normal blood ran out. The man replies "Christ is in all of us". After more prompting he says that the blood is from the bishop, [[Vitali Udinesi]], and that it is purer. We push more ketamine on the man, who we find is named Paul, and he drifts to drugged sleep.

### Where the blood goes

[[Pierre]] enters a room swathed in candlelight. On it is a map of Europe, with a number of nodes that seem unrelated, apart from one in [[Italy|Naples]] and one in [[Serbia|Belgrade]]. [[Pierre]] commits the map to memory -- other nodes include [[England|London]], [[Manchester]], Several places in [[Romania]], several cities in [[Ukraine]], Lebanon, [[Lebanon|Beirut]], [[Palestine]], [[Egypt|Cairo]] and [[Italy|Rome]]. 

At the far side of the room is the silhouette of a man in [[NATO]] military dress. [[Pierre]] fakes a bow but continues looking at him. The man has a large moustache and looks similar to Mussolini (but importantly, is not). The man opens the box, takes the syringe out without incident, injects it under his tongue. His eyes roll back in his head and he gets an erection. 

The man says "Wait" in [[Romania|Romanian]]. "I have something for you to deliver to your master". He walks over and rifles through some documents in a filing cabinet. "Take these, very securely, to your master. Great importance that this is not fall into the wrong hands". He sounds like he is starting to slur his words, almost as if he has taken drugs. He hands [[Pierre]] a cold-war era folder with documents in. [[Pierre]] motions to ask if he can leave. The man inhales deeply.

>"You are not Paul"
>
>"Paul couldn't make it today"
>
>"Show me your face"

[[Pierre]] bluffs that he is going to take his helmet off and attempts to bolt for the door, and the man is completely blindsided. [[Pierre]] seems to think that the man is on Heroin from how he is acting. [[Pierre]], terrified, goes to sprint out the door and up the stairs, but the man catches up and grabs [[Pierre]]'s belt. The man's eyes are bloodshot, and his face animalisticaly contorts into almost a bird-like or ghoulish form as he screams and reaches for [[Pierre]]'s face. 

[[Pierre]]'s anti grappling training kicks in and he goes to remove the man's hand. Despite landing a powerful blow the man barely moves, but going to break his arm for a second time [[Pierre]] barely gets him off his belt. At neck-a-neck speeds [[Pierre]] gets out of the bunker first, and looks back to see that the man is not following, with a face like a dead shark. 

[[Pierre]] gets on the bike and heads out the same gate as the biker. He notices all of the cameras swivel to look at him. [[Pierre]] gets stopped at the gate, and the man checks his ID, talks to his friend for a few seconds, and then hands it back, allowing [[Pierre]] to leave. 

After recounting our previous experiences and what drew us here, we come to the conclusion that we are dealing with [[Vampires]]. Looking in the folder, we then see that across [[Serbia|Belgrade]], both in the townhouse and in the getaway car, there a number of photos of us. All of our faces have clean shots. There are no names however. We decide to leave.

We get a text from [[Georg Rudek|Rudek]] right as we're leaving.
> East.

## Session 2
We reply to Rudek

> Heading East now. Where should we go

At the same time, we also get a phone call from the hotel reception to our internal pone, mentioning that some men are here to see us. [[Dazzer]] hears three sets of heavyset footsteps coming towards us. We're on the second floor.

We also see several unmarked police cars, and plain clothes police officers. Additionally, there is a poorly painted flower van which indicated something akin to a SWAT van, bomb squad, etc. [[Firebolt]] remembers a laundry chute which he picked this room to be next to as he pushes a mattress against the door, . The group decide to use it to get to the bottom of the building and escape that way. As [[Pierre]] pulls the fire alarm, a man bursts down the hotel room door with a battering ram. We see several police officers dressed in full riot gear. 

### Carabinieri

[[Firebolt]] shoots a flashbang that an officer is holding before it can be thrown into the room, setting it off in the corridor. [[Dazzer]] punches in the drywall to the laundry shoot as [[Pierre]] jumps down it. One of the officers breaks into the room and shoots [[Firebolt]], before him and [[Dazzer]] jump down the laundry chute into the pile of clothes [[Pierre]] had laid out. 

[[Firebolt]] flash-welds a grate to the bottom of the chute using thermite as [[Pierre]] uses a crowbar to rip off boards from the disused laundry chute room. We sprint through an abandoned kitchen area. It's been abandoned and minestrone soup is burning on the stove. We sprint through following fire exits and break open some staff lockers. We find one full set of chef's uniforms, as well as a number of spare casual clothes. 

We quickly change clothes and add some makeup to ourselves to appear different. [[Pierre]] uses his expertise in disguise to make us as unrecognisable as ourselves as possible. [[Dazzer]] manages to convince the police outside that we're civilians who aren't worth dealing with. The police say there has been a bomb threat called in by the [[Italy|Naples]] [[NATO]] base. 

### Plan B

As we are leaving the police blockade, [[Dazzer]] notices that someone in a long black coat with sunglasses is tailing us with the unnerving accuracy of a trained special agent. We head down an alleyway about 5 minutes away. We discuss how to deal with him, but the figure arrives far sooner than should be possible. He says "Nice spot" in Italian. 

[[Dazzer]] throws a knife directly at the man's head. He jumps back and swings around the corner with supernatural speed, before shouting:

>"I just want to talk. [[The Board of Directors|We]] can give you information and pay you off in exchange for your silence"
>
>[[Firebolt]]: "Why don't we start with your name"
> 
>"I'd much rather speak eye to eye with you"

He walks around the corner again, drops his weapons, and returns the knife. There's a hole below his eye that's bleeding profusely. He barely seems to notice. 

> "Nice job shaking the police. My [[The Board of Directors|Supervisors]] thought it would be enough but I was happy with plan B. We want to offer you 10 million dollars each"
>
>[[Pierre]]: "In exchange for?" 
>
>"The copy of the laptop, and, implicitly - your interest in it."

The man is willing to trade us information as well - stating that he knows how well we've done. [[Pierre]] asks why it's so important. He asks why we came to [[Italy|Naples]] right after [[Noble Jump]]. He states that "we must know about [[Sardinia]] already."

>"My [[The Board of Directors|Supervisors]] operate an international ring of sorts. We have our finger in many pies - we are invisible, but you can infer the presence of an invisible object by the trail it leaves behind. That's what [[Malcolm Lennart|Lennart]] was pulling together. We don't want this information putting together that's why we're offering you so much money - We don't want it on the black market, which is why we're offering you more than you'd get for it there. Our clients rely on us to keep things discrete. Yours is the sort of leap that threatens that. "

The man says he's a "man on the ground" for one of his [[The Board of Directors|Directors]]. 

[[Pierre]] asks where he could get the money from and the man assures him by listing the vault key for one of the largest casinos in [[France|Paris]]. [[Dazzer]] is unhappy with what the man is offering - saying he wouldn't be happy that he's not just being fed lies. The man states that everything is a lie, that nobody understands everything, but he can get us a step closer. 

The man arranges for us to each get $1 million each to sweeten negotiations. He sends a text, and a minute or two later we see the funds in our account. 

[[Firebolt]] asks who and what their clients are. He responds that a client has significant political power, and that typically payment is in favours. They facilitate networking between CEOs, heads of state, religious leaders, bankers, etc. 

[[Pierre]] asks how he got involved. The man said he was scouted - he was a pro wrestler then broke his neck. They put him on a "special treatment" and he's been fine since. [[Firebolt]] asks when - and the man who looks 25 says it was 22 years ago. 

[[Firebolt]] asks if his masters are still human - he says no. They're "not quite vampires" - they're not undead and not here to terrorise humanity. [[The Board of Directors]] have a "very special set of medical needs". They need high-platelet blood and occasionally have cannibalistic tendencies. This is likely where the stories about vampires come from. 

We find that [[Anton Dedopovich|Anton]] has a chronic liver condition that he was receiving treatments for in Switzerland. He likely was trying to kill us to steal the data and blackmail [[The Board of Directors]] for their treatment. [[The Board of Directors]] have been, supposedly, transparent with their sole interest of securing and destroying the data.

[[Dazzer]] asks what the treatment costs. The man replies "better than you" before realising [[Dazzer]] is talking about farms. [[The Board of Directors|They]] had apparently been organising policy change in the EU via the UK before Russia meddled in the elections. This meddling has set their plans back a number of years.

[[Dazzer]] then asks what sets [[The Board of Directors|Them]] apart from everyone else. He replies that there is change in brain chemistry along with this process that reduces your ability to emphasise and see people as worth something. Finally, we get to what [[The Board of Directors|They]] want.

He says that [[The Board of Directors|They]] want copies of all the data, full license to go through all accounts and check for copies, then go and burn all of our relevant covers to prevent access to the intelligence world, then provide a number of options on places to live in the world. There'll be countries that are off limits, and additionally the money presented.[[Pierre]] asks, and the man says [[The Board of Directors|They]] are open for negotiation on some terms.

Following a brief breakdown in communication and note taking, the man makes to run, and jumps noiselessly onto a car then a truck. He is about to swing from a lamppost and onto a roof, when [[Firebolt]] shoots him in the neck, making him fall.[[Dazzer]] goes to break into a nearby civilian car and we pile in to leave. We plan what to do next

### New Threads

[[Firebolt]] calls [[Georg Rudek|Rudek]]'s phone number. A man answers, and in Arabic says "Yes?". He says that he is called Jonny. Jonny says that he intended for his text to get us killed. He says that he is a wet worker and was made at The Farm, and doesn't remember where he's from, but sounds like he's from perhaps [[Palestine]] or [[Syria]]. The call triangulated to [[Lebanon]], in Beirut. 

[[Leuchtturm|Anders]] discovered that there was an account with lots of money going in and out of it, codenamed [[sùrbiles]]. In this account, we find a number of reports of violent murders throughout the region which have been classified and covered up. The timing of these incidents lines up with when [[Noble Jump]] started being talked about publicly. Of notes, bars of raw silver were imported to [[Sardinia]] in the months leading to [[Noble Jump]]. Additionally, we find that the [[Knights of Malta]] were present in [[Sardinia]]. 

[[Pierre]] posits that perhaps silver works like alcohol or combat drugs to Vampires. [[Dazzer]] offers that perhaps there are some evil vampires that need to be suppressed. [[Firebolt]] says that perhaps [[Noble Jump]] was a training exercise for new Vampires. None of us know anything about the significance of silver 

We decide to head to [[Austria|Vienna]] to investigate the bank accounts that originally paid us for [[(01) Operation Chocolate Labrador]], alongside the connections to the [[Russian Mafia]]. We start off by heading to the [Oberbank](https://www.oberbank.at/filialdetail/wien). [[Leuchtturm|Anders]] additionally discoverers that the bank was part of the chain responsible for using funds to purchase silver. [[Christoph Noebauer]] is responsible for the deal. 

We discover that [[Christoph Noebauer]] is part of a rolling stones cover band called [The Stonez](http://stonez.at/concerts/). We decide to kidnap him after one of his concerts.
